# Dir2md Feature Comparison: Open Source vs Pro

> Transform your codebase into LLM-optimized markdown blueprints.

Dir2md follows an open-core model: core functionality remains free, while advanced capabilities are available in the commercial Pro build.

## Open Source Features (MIT License)

### Core Functionality
- [*] Directory scanning with `.gitignore` awareness.
- [*] Include, exclude, and omit glob filters using gitwildmatch semantics.
- [=] Token budgeting with configurable head and tail sampling.
- [*] SimHash-based duplicate detection to minimize repeated content.
- [=] Optional JSON manifest output with file hashes and statistics.
- [+] Deterministic builds via `--no-timestamp`.
- [*] Presets for `iceberg`, `pro`, and `raw` (raw disables manifest output).

### Basic Security
- [#] Built-in masking guardrails for common secrets:
  - AWS Access Keys (`AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}`)
  - Bearer Tokens (`Bearer <token>`)
  - Private Keys (`-----BEGIN ... PRIVATE KEY-----` blocks with multiline masking)
  - GitHub Personal Access Tokens (`gh[pousr]_<36 chars>`)
  - Generic API key assignments (`api_key=...`, `x-api-key=...`)
  - Database URLs (`postgres://`, `mysql://`, `mongodb+srv://`, `redis://`, `sqlserver://`)
  - JWT tokens (`header.payload.signature`)
  - OAuth client secrets (`client_secret=...`)
- [#] Custom masking hooks via `--mask-pattern` CLI flag or `mask_patterns` in `pyproject.toml`.

### Output Modes
- [*] Reference mode: metadata-only entries for compact manifests.
- [*] Summary mode: condensed inline snippets.
- [*] Inline mode: sampled file content within token budgets.

### CLI & Integration
- [T] Full-featured CLI with contextual help.
- [T] pyproject-driven defaults via `[tool.dir2md]` configuration.
- [+] Automatic `.env` discovery for shared presets and licenses.
- [T] Dry-run hashing for quick pipeline checks.

## Pro Version Features

### Advanced Security & Compliance
- [#] 25+ masking patterns covering major cloud providers and SaaS platforms.
- [#] Custom pattern support with context-aware false-positive reduction.
- [#] Audit logs for compliance reporting.

### Performance & Scale
- [=] Parallel directory walkers for multi-threaded analysis.
- [=] Incremental caching (`.dir2md_cache/`) for faster re-runs.
- [=] Streaming mode to handle repositories with 10,000+ files.

### Advanced Analysis
- [T] Language-aware plugins (Python AST summaries, JS/TS export detection, Go packages, Java classes).
- [=] Drift detection to compare blueprint revisions.
- [=] Impact scoring to highlight critical changes.

### Export & Sharing
- [T] Multiple export formats: HTML, PDF, and slide decks.
- [T] Customizable templates (Jinja2) for branded output.
- [T] Responsive HTML optimized for mobile and print workflows.

### Team & CI/CD Integration
- [+] GitHub Actions and GitLab CI reference pipelines.
- [+] Pull request comments with blueprint excerpts.
- [+] Status checks and policy gates for documentation quality.
- [+] Team templates for consistent deliverables.

### Developer Experience
- [T] Interactive terminal UI for selective exports.
- [T] Live preview server for instant feedback.
- [=] Advanced configuration profiles for teams.
- [=] Analytics dashboard for usage insights.
